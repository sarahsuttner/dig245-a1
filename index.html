  <h2> Sarah Suttner </h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Sarah. I'm a junior from San Diego, California, and I'm double majoring in Digital and Screen Media and Music.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course to increase my knowledge regarding web design and to fulfill one of my major's Production and Methodology requirements.</p>
    <p>I have no prior experience in programming for the web, but I have used R in my Introduction to Statistics course.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Here are some websites that I find interesting:</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.cyclemon.com/mobile/">Cyclemon</a></p>
    <p>The website is intriguing because of its appealing artistic simplicity and interactivity. While not entirely necessary for depicting prints of bikes, the presentation of the site makes the purpose behind the company feel like much more. I came across this site while looking at engaging website formats for Tally Saves the Internet.</p>
    <p><a href="http://species-in-pieces.com/">Species in Pieces</a></p>
    <p>This exhibition is interesting for a number of reasons. It's an incredibly unique way to bring awareness to endangered animals, but it's also a fascinating portrayal of a "fragmented" existence through fragmented art.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/mygrandmotherslingo/">Species in Pieces</a></p>
    <p>This site is dedicated to the preservation of the rapidly decaying Aboriginal Australian languages. More like an interactive cinematic experience than merely a website, it encourages both practical and conscientious thought regarding the importance and nostalgia of language and culture.</p>
